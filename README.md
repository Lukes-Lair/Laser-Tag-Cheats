# Laser Tag Cheats
This Hack is like 4 little hacks in one. 4 cheats can be activated in the same way as teams can be picked. You can use the extra green wires from the box. Put one end into Ground(GRD) and the other into one of 4 pins; A4, A5, A6, or A7. You can use any of these at the same time. If you use none of them then the laser tag will work normaly with a few optimizations from me.
## A4 | Invincibility
The name is self-explanatory but in case you are one of those dumbos who chose evil croissants, this cheat makes you unable to be hit(you are basically Neo). This one is pretty obvious when used so be careful when you use it.
## A5 | Laser Yourself
This cheat is meant to be activated on the enemy's blaster before the game starts. It enables the ir receiver to receive the signal that your Laser shoots. Therefor the enemy hits themself. It doesn't work every shot as it would make it obvious.
## A6 | Beamer
This cheat disables the delay of the trigger and the need to let go of the button. This allows you to shoot a continuous beam.
## A7 | ALways shoot + Dim
I didn't have a good name for one but it's one of my favorites. When you get shot instead of fully blinding you it only dims it plus it allows you to shoot while the dim is on giving you a major advantage over the other players.
